Re-vendoring librsvg
====================

Upstream stopped vendoring their releases. For now, we re-vendor the crates under debian/missing-sources so we can build the package. 
To do so, run the following steps for a new upstream release:

	$ rm -rf debian/missing-sources
	$ mkdir debian/missing-sources
	$ cargo vendor debian/missing-sources

This will vendor all needed dependencies.
